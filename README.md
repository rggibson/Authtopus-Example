Authtopus Example
=================

This is a very basic example application for [Authtopus](https://github.com/rggibson/Authtopus), an authorization library for Google Cloud Endpoints that supports username and password registration + login, as well as social login via Facebook and Google.  This repository also acts as a very simple seed project for a new AngularJS app hosted on Google App Engine with authentication built in.
